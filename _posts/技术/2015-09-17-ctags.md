当使用Ctrl + T跳转时遇到tag 1 of 2 or more提示，通过下面的方法解决：   
\*tag\* \*tags\*
A tag is an identifier that appears in a "tags" file. It is a sort of label
that can be jumped to. For example: In C programs each function name can be
used as a tag. The "tags" file has to be generated by a program like ctags,
before the tag commands can be used.

With the ":tag" command the cursor will be positioned on the tag. With the
CTRL-] command, the keyword on which the cursor is standing is used as the
tag. If the cursor is not on a keyword, the first keyword to the right of the
cursor is used.

The ":tag" command works very well for C programs. If you see a call to a
function and wonder what that function does, position the cursor inside of the
function name and hit CTRL-]. This will bring you to the function definition.
An easy way back is with the CTRL-T command. Also read about the tag stack
below.

When there is no other message, Vim shows which matching tag has been jumped
to, and the number of matching tags:
tag 1 of 3 or more    
** The " or more" is used to indicate that Vim didn't try all the tags files yet.
When using ":tnext" a few times, or with ":tlast", more matches may be found.**
